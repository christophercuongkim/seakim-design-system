/**
 * Types for the package entry point.
 *
 * Mirrors index.js, but with extensionless specifiers so TypeScript resolves each
 * component's .d.ts rather than the .jsx beside it. Without this file a consuming
 * app under `strict` fails with TS7016 — the components are all typed, but the
 * barrel that re-exports them was not.
 *
 * Keep in step with index.js.
