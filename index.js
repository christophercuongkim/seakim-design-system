/**
 * The client boundary for the whole component library.
 *
 * Every interactive SeaKim component keeps hover, press, and selection state
 * internally, so all of them are Client Components. This one directive marks
 * everything re-exported below, which is why no component file carries its own —
 * the shared library never has to know that Next exists.
 *
 * Imports here are RELATIVE on purpose. That makes this file work unchanged in
 * both consumption models: installed from git into node_modules, or copied into
 * an app and reached through a path alias.
 *
 *     import { Button, Field, Input } from "@seakim/design-system";
 *
 * GENERATED-ADJACENT: keep in step with next/lib/seakim.ts, which re-exports
 * this file. `node tool/conformance-check.mjs` fails if a component in
 * components/ is missing from it.
