 * Trigger-anchored contextual overlay — the third overlay species (0022). Sits
 * next to the element that spawned it, because its meaning is "this, here": a
 * menu under a button, an autocomplete list under a field, a reaction bar.
 *
 * Two modes. `modal` gets a scrim, takes focus, and traps it loosely; the
 * default non-modal mode has no scrim, leaves focus on the trigger, and dismisses
 * on outside-press, Escape, or trigger blur. For a screen-anchored modal use
 * `Dialog`; for a bottom sheet use the sheet species.
